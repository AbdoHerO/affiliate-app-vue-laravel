# Affiliate Panel Runtime Fixes - Issue Resolution

## ðŸ”§ Issues Identified and Fixed

### Issue 1: Order Detail 500 Error âœ… FIXED
**Error**: `SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'telephone' in 'field list'`

**Root Cause**: OrdersController was trying to load `telephone` field from `boutiques` table which doesn't exist.

**Fix Applied**:
1. **OrdersController.php**: Removed `telephone` from boutique relationship loading
   ```php
   // Before: 'boutique:id,nom,adresse,telephone'
   // After:  'boutique:id,nom,adresse'
   ```

2. **OrderResource.php**: Removed `telephone` field from boutique data transformation
   ```php
   // Removed: 'telephone' => $this->boutique->telephone ?? null,
   ```

**Result**: âœ… Order detail endpoint now returns 200 with proper data structure

### Issue 2: Ticket Attachment Route Missing âœ… FIXED
**Error**: `Route [affiliate.tickets.attachments.download] not defined`

**Root Cause**: Missing route definition for ticket attachment downloads.

**Fix Applied**:
1. **routes/api.php**: Added missing route
   ```php
   Route::get('tickets/attachments/{id}/download', [TicketsController::class, 'downloadAttachment'])
       ->name('affiliate.tickets.attachments.download');
   ```

2. **TicketsController.php**: Added `downloadAttachment` method with:
   - Ownership verification through ticket relationship
   - File existence checks
   - Proper error handling
   - Security validation (affiliate-only access)

**Result**: âœ… Ticket attachments can now be downloaded securely

---

### Issue 3: Authentication Middleware Error âœ… FIXED
**Error**: `Route [login] not defined` causing 500 errors on unauthenticated requests

**Root Cause**: Laravel's auth middleware trying to redirect to undefined 'login' route for API requests.

**Fix Applied**:
1. **bootstrap/app.php**: Added proper authentication redirect handling
   ```php
   $middleware->redirectGuestsTo(function ($request) {
       if ($request->expectsJson() || $request->is('api/*')) {
           abort(401, 'Unauthenticated.');
       }
       return '/login'; // Use path instead of route name
   });
   ```

**Result**: âœ… API requests now return proper 401 responses instead of 500 errors

---

### Issue 4: Frontend Withdrawal Actions âœ… FIXED
**Error**: "View Details" action not working, missing store integration

**Root Cause**: Frontend method trying to use non-existent store method.

**Fix Applied**:
1. **payments/index.vue**: Fixed `viewWithdrawalDetails` method
   - Uses existing `fetchWithdrawal` store method
   - Accesses `currentWithdrawal` from store refs
   - Proper error handling with user feedback

2. **Store Integration**: Added `currentWithdrawal` to reactive refs
   ```typescript
   const { currentWithdrawal, ... } = storeToRefs(paymentsStore)
   ```

**Result**: âœ… "View Details" action now works and displays withdrawal information
