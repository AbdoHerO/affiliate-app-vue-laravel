## 🔍 DETAILED FINDINGS

### Current vs Expected Pricing Model

#### **Expected Pricing Model (Business Requirements)**
```
Database Fields:
- prix_achat: Wholesale/cost price (e.g., 100 MAD)
- prix_vente: Recommended retail price (e.g., 150 MAD)  
- prix_affilie: Fixed commission amount (optional, e.g., 50 MAD)
- prix_unitaire: Actual sale price used by affiliate

Commission Rules:
1. Recommended Price + Fixed Commission → Commission = prix_affilie × qty
2. Recommended Price + No Fixed Commission → Commission = (prix_vente - prix_achat) × qty
3. Modified Price → Commission = (sale_price - prix_achat) × qty
4. Minimum Rule → Commission cannot be negative
```

#### **Current Implementation (CommissionService)**
```
Current Logic:
- Uses percentage-based calculation on total line amount
- base_amount = article->total_ligne
- commission = (base_amount × rate) / 100
- Does NOT consider cost price (prix_achat)
- Does NOT implement margin-based calculation
```

### Calculation Comparison Table

| Scenario | Product | Cost | Recommended | Sale | Qty | Current | Expected | Difference | Rule |
|----------|---------|------|-------------|------|-----|---------|----------|------------|------|
| **Recommended Price** | Product 1 | 100.00 | 150.00 | 150.00 | 2 | 45.00 | 100.00 | **55.00** | RECOMMENDED_MARGIN |
| **Modified Higher** | Product 2 | 80.00 | 120.00 | 140.00 | 1 | 21.00 | 60.00 | **39.00** | MODIFIED_MARGIN |
| **Modified Lower** | Product 2 | 80.00 | 120.00 | 100.00 | 1 | 15.00 | 20.00 | **5.00** | MODIFIED_MARGIN |

### Pricing Scenarios Analysis

| Scenario | Count | Current Total | Expected Total | Variance |
|----------|-------|---------------|----------------|----------|
| **Recommended Margin** | 2 | 45.00 MAD | 200.00 MAD | **+344%** |
| **Modified Margin** | 2 | 36.00 MAD | 80.00 MAD | **+122%** |
| **Fixed Commission** | 0 | 0.00 MAD | 0.00 MAD | 0% |

## 🚨 BUSINESS IMPACT

### Financial Impact
- **Affiliate Underpayment:** 199.00 MAD in test data alone
- **Scaling Impact:** If applied across all affiliates, significant revenue leakage
- **Profitability Miscalculation:** Business margins not accurately reflected

### Operational Impact
- **Affiliate Satisfaction:** Affiliates receiving lower commissions than expected
- **Pricing Strategy:** Cannot accurately measure pricing effectiveness
- **Business Intelligence:** Commission reports do not reflect true profitability

### Compliance Impact
- **Contract Fulfillment:** May not be meeting affiliate agreement terms
- **Audit Risk:** Commission calculations not aligned with documented business rules

## 🔧 TECHNICAL ROOT CAUSE

### Current CommissionService Issues

1. **Incorrect Base Amount Calculation**
   ```php
   // Current (WRONG)
   $baseAmount = $article->total_ligne;
   
   // Expected (CORRECT)
   $marginPerUnit = max(0, $salePrice - $costPrice);
   $baseAmount = $marginPerUnit * $quantity;
   ```

2. **Missing Pricing Model Logic**
   - No consideration of `prix_achat` (cost price)
   - No implementation of fixed commission (`prix_affilie`)
   - No differentiation between recommended vs modified pricing

3. **Percentage vs Margin Confusion**
   - Current: Percentage of total sale amount
   - Expected: Absolute margin amount (sale - cost)
