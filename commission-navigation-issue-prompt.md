# **Commission Detail View Navigation Issue - Prompt for Copilot AI**

## **Problem Description**

The commission management system has a critical navigation issue where clicking the "View Detail" (eye icon) button in the commission list table does nothing. The button should navigate to the commission detail page but instead causes a page reload and throws a JavaScript error.

## **Current Symptoms**

1. **View Button Click**: No navigation occurs when clicking the view (eye) icon
2. **JavaScript Error**: `Uncaught (in promise) RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded` in axios.js
3. **Page Behavior**: Page reloads instead of navigating to detail view
4. **Console Output**: Shows navigation initiated but no actual route change

## **Expected Behavior**

- Clicking view button should navigate from `/admin/commissions` to `/admin/commissions/{id}`
- Commission detail page should load and display commission information
- No JavaScript errors should occur

## **Technical Context**

- **Frontend**: Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vuexy template + Vue Router
- **Backend**: Laravel 11 API
- **Architecture**: SPA with API endpoints
- **Current Route**: `/admin/commissions` (list page)
- **Target Route**: `/admin/commissions/{id}` (detail page)

## **Files That Need Investigation/Modification**

### **1. Commission List Page (Main Issue)**
```
starter-kit/resources/ts/pages/admin/commissions.vue
```
- Contains the `handleView` function that should trigger navigation
- Uses ActionIcon component for the view button
- Current implementation uses `router.push()` but navigation fails

### **2. Commission Detail Page**
```
starter-kit/resources/ts/pages/admin/commissions/[id]/index.vue
```
- Target page that should display commission details
- May have issues with data loading or component initialization
- Uses commission store to fetch data

### **3. Commission Store (Data Management)**
```
starter-kit/resources/ts/stores/admin/commissions.ts
```
- Contains `fetchCommission` method that loads individual commission data
- May have circular reference issues causing axios stack overflow
- Handles API communication for commission details

### **4. ActionIcon Component (UI Component)**
```
starter-kit/resources/ts/components/common/ActionIcon.vue
```
- Reusable component used for action buttons
- Handles click events and emits to parent
- May have event handling issues

### **5. Commission API Controller (Backend)**
```
starter-kit/app/Http/Controllers/Admin/CommissionsController.php
```
- Contains `show` method for fetching individual commission
- May have issues with data relationships or circular references

### **6. Commission Resource (Data Serialization)**
```
starter-kit/app/Http/Resources/Admin/CommissionResource.php
```
- Transforms commission data for API responses
- May contain circular references in nested relationships
- Could be causing axios serialization issues

## **Specific Issues to Address**

### **1. Navigation Problem**
- `router.push()` in `handleView` function not working
- Route configuration may be incorrect
- Event handling in ActionIcon component may be blocked

### **2. Axios Stack Overflow**
- Circular reference in commission data structure
- Infinite recursion in axios interceptors
- Nested relationships causing serialization issues

### **3. Route Configuration**
- Dynamic route `[id]` may not be properly configured
- Route guards or navigation guards may be interfering
- Vue Router setup issues

## **Current Code Snippets**

### **handleView Function (Not Working)**
```typescript
const handleView = (commission: Commission, event?: Event) => {
  console.log('üîç handleView called for commission:', commission.id)
  
  if (event) {
    event.preventDefault()
    event.stopPropagation()
  }
  
  const targetPath = `/admin/commissions/${commission.id}`
  console.log('üéØ Navigating to:', targetPath)
  
  try {
    router.push(targetPath)
    console.log('‚úÖ Navigation initiated')
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('‚ùå Navigation error:', error)
    showError('Erreur de navigation vers les d√©tails de la commission')
  }
}
```

### **ActionIcon Usage**
```vue
<ActionIcon
  icon="tabler-eye"
  label="actions.view"
  variant="default"
  @click="handleView(item)"
/>
```

## **Debugging Information**

- Console shows navigation initiated but no route change
- No network requests made to commission detail API
- Page reloads instead of SPA navigation
- Axios error suggests circular reference in data

## **Required Solution**

1. **Fix navigation issue** - Ensure view button properly navigates to detail page
2. **Resolve axios error** - Fix circular reference causing stack overflow
3. **Ensure data loading** - Commission detail page should load and display data
4. **Maintain consistency** - Use same patterns as other working CRUD pages

## **Testing Requirements**

- View button should navigate without page reload
- Commission detail page should display complete information
- No JavaScript errors in console
- Back navigation should work properly
- URL should update correctly in browser

## **Priority**

**HIGH** - This is a critical functionality issue preventing users from viewing commission details, which is essential for the commission management workflow.
