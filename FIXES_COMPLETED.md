# üöÄ Issues Fixed - Vue.js + Laravel Affiliate Platform

## ‚úÖ Issue 1: Success Alert Not Showing After Checkout - RESOLVED

### Problem
- Success notifications were not appearing after successful checkout
- `useNotifications` composable was using `readonly()` preventing state updates

### Solution
- **Fixed `useNotifications.ts`**: 
  - Replaced individual `ref()` instances with global `reactive()` state
  - Removed `readonly()` wrapper that was blocking state updates
  - Made notification state global and shared across all component instances
  - Used `Object.assign()` for proper reactive updates

### Files Modified
- `resources/ts/composables/useNotifications.ts`

### Result
- ‚úÖ Success notifications now appear immediately after checkout
- ‚úÖ Order reference is displayed in notification
- ‚úÖ Error notifications also work properly
- ‚úÖ Notifications appear in top-right corner as expected
