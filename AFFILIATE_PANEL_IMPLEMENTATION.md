# Affiliate Panel Implementation

This document describes the implementation of three key Affiliate Panel features that reuse Admin UI/UX patterns while providing affiliate-scoped functionality.

## Overview

The implementation includes:
1. **Orders History** - Full status tracking for affiliate orders
2. **Payments** - Commissions ledger and withdrawals management
3. **Support Tickets** - Complete ticket system for affiliate support

All features maintain UI/UX parity with the Admin panel while enforcing strict ownership and visibility rules.

## Architecture & Security

### Backend Controllers
- **Namespace**: `App\Http\Controllers\Affiliate\`
- **Authentication**: `auth:sanctum` + `role:affiliate` middleware
- **Authorization**: All queries scoped to current affiliate (`user_id`)
- **Validation**: Server-side validation with detailed error messages

### Frontend Implementation
- **Stores**: Pinia stores in `resources/ts/stores/affiliate/`
- **Pages**: Vue components in `resources/ts/pages/affiliate/`
- **Reused Components**: Admin UI components with affiliate-specific adaptations

## Feature 1: Orders History

### Backend
- **Controller**: `App\Http\Controllers\Affiliate\OrdersController`
- **Routes**: 
  - `GET /affiliate/orders` - List orders with filters
  - `GET /affiliate/orders/{id}` - Order details

### Frontend
- **Store**: `useAffiliateOrdersStore`
- **Pages**: 
  - `/affiliate/orders` - Orders list
  - `/affiliate/orders/{id}` - Order detail

### Features
- ✅ Ownership-scoped queries (only affiliate's orders)
- ✅ Status badges matching Admin semantics
- ✅ Comprehensive filtering (status, date range, search)
- ✅ Server-side pagination and sorting
- ✅ Read-only access (no admin actions)
- ✅ Order timeline and commission tracking
- ✅ Detailed order information with articles and shipping

### Security
- All queries filtered by `user_id = current_affiliate_id`
- No access to other affiliates' data
- Read-only interface with no destructive actions

## Feature 2: Payments (Commissions & Withdrawals)

### Backend
- **Controller**: `App\Http\Controllers\Affiliate\PaymentsController`
- **Routes**:
  - `GET /affiliate/commissions` - Commissions list with summary
  - `GET /affiliate/withdrawals` - Withdrawals list
  - `GET /affiliate/withdrawals/{id}` - Withdrawal details
  - `POST /affiliate/withdrawals/request` - Request payout

### Frontend
- **Store**: `useAffiliatePaymentsStore`
- **Page**: `/affiliate/payments` (with tabs)

### Features
- ✅ **Commissions Tab**:
  - Per-status totals and counts
  - Filtering by status, date range, amount
  - Commission details with order linkage
- ✅ **Withdrawals Tab**:
  - Withdrawal history with status tracking
  - Detail view with included commission lines
- ✅ **Request Payout**:
  - Only enabled when eligible commissions exist
  - Business rule validation on server
  - Automatic commission aggregation

### Security
- Commissions scoped to current affiliate
- Payout requests validate eligible commissions
- No admin-only actions (approve, mark paid, etc.)

## Feature 3: Support Tickets

### Backend
- **Controller**: `App\Http\Controllers\Affiliate\TicketsController`
- **Routes**:
  - `GET /affiliate/tickets` - List tickets
  - `POST /affiliate/tickets` - Create ticket
  - `GET /affiliate/tickets/{id}` - Ticket details
  - `POST /affiliate/tickets/{id}/messages` - Add message
  - `PATCH /affiliate/tickets/{id}/status` - Update status (close/reopen)

### Frontend
- **Store**: `useAffiliateTicketsStore`
- **Pages**:
  - `/affiliate/tickets` - Tickets list
  - `/affiliate/tickets/{id}` - Ticket thread

### Features
- ✅ **Ticket Management**:
  - Create tickets with subject, category, priority
  - File attachments support
  - Filtering by status, priority, category
- ✅ **Thread View**:
  - Chronological message display
  - Reply functionality with attachments
  - Close/reopen tickets
- ✅ **Security**:
  - Only own tickets accessible
  - Internal admin notes hidden
  - No admin macros (assign, escalate)

## UI/UX Parity

### Reused Components
- `Breadcrumbs` - Navigation breadcrumbs
- `ConfirmActionDialog` - Confirmation dialogs
- Status badges with consistent colors
- Data tables with server-side pagination
- Filter components and layouts

### Consistent Patterns
- Same table structures as Admin views
- Identical status color schemes
- Consistent error handling and notifications
- Matching loading states and empty states
- Same form validation patterns

## Navigation Updates

Updated affiliate navigation in `resources/ts/navigation/vertical/index.ts`:
```typescript
{
  title: 'nav_my_orders',
  to: '/affiliate/orders',
  icon: { icon: 'tabler-shopping-cart' },
},
{
  title: 'nav_my_payments',
  to: '/affiliate/payments',
  icon: { icon: 'tabler-currency-dollar' },
},
{
  title: 'nav_support',
  to: '/affiliate/tickets',
  icon: { icon: 'tabler-headset' },
},
```

## Testing

### Happy Path Testing
1. **Orders**: List and view own orders, filter by status/date
2. **Payments**: View commissions by status, request payout when eligible
3. **Tickets**: Create tickets, add messages, close/reopen

### Security Testing
1. Verify ownership scoping (cannot access other affiliates' data)
2. Test authorization checks (only approved affiliates)
3. Validate business rules (payout eligibility)

### Edge Cases
1. Empty states for new affiliates
2. Large datasets with pagination
3. File upload limits and validation
4. Network errors and retry mechanisms

## Performance Considerations

- Server-side pagination for all lists
- Debounced filter inputs
- Eager loading of relationships
- Optimized queries with proper indexing
- Request cancellation on rapid filter changes

## Error Handling

- Server error messages displayed verbatim
- Consistent toast notifications for async operations
- Inline validation errors for forms
- Graceful handling of authorization failures
- Retry mechanisms for failed requests

## Future Enhancements

1. Real-time notifications for ticket updates
2. Export functionality for commissions/withdrawals
3. Advanced filtering and search capabilities
4. Mobile-responsive optimizations
5. Bulk operations where appropriate

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Affiliate Access (403 Errors)
**Problem**: User `0198cd28-0b1f-7170-a26f-61e13ab21d72` was getting 403 errors on affiliate APIs.
**Solution**:
- Fixed user approval status to `approved`
- Ensured affiliate role assignment
- Created affiliate profile with proper tier assignment
- Used `FixAffiliateAccess` command to automate the fix

### 2. Navigation Links
**Problem**: Navigation links not showing in affiliate panel.
**Solution**:
- Updated `useNavigation.ts` composable with correct route names
- Fixed route mapping for new affiliate features
- Removed conflicting placeholder pages

### 3. Placeholder Pages
**Problem**: Orders menu opened "Coming Soon" placeholder instead of real functionality.
**Solution**:
- Removed conflicting `affiliate/orders.vue` placeholder
- Ensured proper routing to `affiliate/orders/index.vue`

### 4. Field Name Mismatches
**Problem**: Database field names didn't match controller/frontend expectations.
**Solution**:
- Updated TicketMessage fields: `user_id` → `sender_id`, `message` → `body`, `is_internal` → `type`
- Fixed ticket categories to match database enum values
- Updated all related controllers, stores, and components
