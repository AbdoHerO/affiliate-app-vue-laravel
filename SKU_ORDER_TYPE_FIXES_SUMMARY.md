# SKU and Order Type Display Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Missing SKU in admin commissions table**
2. **Incorrect 'N/A' or 'vente' showing instead of actual order type (exchange, order_sample, etc.)**
3. **Affiliate withdrawal details showing commission type instead of order type**

## Backend Changes

### 1. Fixed Eager Loading in CommissionsController
**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/CommissionsController.php`
- Added `produit_id` to the field selection when eager loading commissions
- This ensures the SKU can be accessed through the product relationship

### 2. Updated Admin Commission Resource  
**File:** `app/Http/Resources/Admin/CommissionResource.php`
- Ensured `type_command` is included in the `commande_article` data
- This provides the actual order type for display

### 3. Updated Admin Withdrawal Resource
**File:** `app/Http/Resources/Admin/WithdrawalResource.php` 
- Added `commande_article` to commission data in withdrawal details
- Enables access to order type information in withdrawal views

### 4. Updated Affiliate Resources
**Files:** 
- `app/Http/Resources/Affiliate/CommissionResource.php`
- `app/Http/Resources/Affiliate/WithdrawalResource.php` 
- `app/Http/Resources/Affiliate/OrderResource.php`
- Added computed `type_command` field for backward compatibility
- Ensured `commande_article` data is included in all relevant resources

## Frontend Changes

### 1. Fixed Admin Commission Table
**File:** `resources/ts/pages/admin/commissions/index.vue`
- Updated SKU column template to access the correct nested path
- Ensured product data is displayed when available

### 2. Fixed Admin Withdrawal Details  
**File:** `resources/ts/pages/admin/withdrawals/[id]/index.vue`
- Updated SKU and order type column templates
- Fixed data access paths for proper display

### 3. Fixed Affiliate Orders Table
**File:** `resources/ts/pages/affiliate/orders/index.vue`  
- Updated to use `type_command` from order resource
- Fixed type column to show actual order type instead of 'N/A'

### 4. Fixed Affiliate Withdrawal Details Modal
**File:** `resources/ts/components/affiliate/WithdrawalDetailsModal.vue`
- Changed table header from 'Type' to 'Type Commande' 
- Updated template to show order type (`commande_article.type_command`) instead of commission type
- Added missing `i18n` import for translations

### 5. Updated TypeScript Interfaces
**Files:**
- `resources/ts/stores/admin/withdrawals.ts`
- `resources/ts/stores/affiliate/payments.ts` 
- `resources/ts/stores/affiliate/orders.ts`
- Updated interfaces to include `commande_article` and `type_command` fields

## Expected Results

### Admin Panel
- **Commissions table:** SKU now displays correctly 
- **Withdrawal details:** Both SKU and order type show proper values

### Affiliate Panel  
- **Orders table:** Type column shows actual order type (exchange, order_sample, etc.)
- **Withdrawal details modal:** Displays order type instead of commission type
- **Commission tables:** All relevant data properly displayed

## Testing

All changes maintain backward compatibility while fixing the data access issues. The modifications ensure:

1. Proper eager loading includes all necessary foreign keys
2. API resources expose the required nested data
3. Frontend templates access the correct data paths
4. TypeScript interfaces reflect the actual data structure

The root cause was missing eager loading relationships and incorrect frontend data access patterns. These fixes ensure the complete data flow from database to UI display.
